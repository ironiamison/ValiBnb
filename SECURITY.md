## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

**DO NOT** open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.

### How to Report

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it by:

1. **Email**: Send details to [security@validnb.org] (to be configured)
2. **Security Advisories**: Use GitHub's Security Advisory feature

### What to Include

- Type of vulnerability (e.g., XSS, SQL injection, etc.)
- Full paths of affected source files
- Location of the affected code
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code
- Potential impact and severity assessment

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Fix Timeline**: Depends on severity (typically 30-90 days)

### Severity Levels

**Critical**
- Remote code execution
- Authentication bypass
- Data exposure

**High**
- Privilege escalation
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Denial of service

**Medium**
- Local vulnerabilities
- Information disclosure
- Path traversal

**Low**
- Social engineering
- Missing best practices

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

ValiBNB implements the following security measures:

### Implemented
- ✅ Helmet.js security headers
- ✅ Rate limiting
- ✅ CORS protection
- ✅ Input validation
- ✅ Error handling without sensitive data
- ✅ HTTPS/SSL enforcement in production
- ✅ Environment variable protection
- ✅ No sensitive data in logs

### Recommendations for Deployment

1. **Always use HTTPS** in production
2. **Set strong environment variables**
3. **Use rate limiting** (already configured)
4. **Monitor logs** for suspicious activity
5. **Keep dependencies updated**:
   ```bash
   npm audit
   npm audit fix
   ```
6. **Use multiple RPC endpoints** for redundancy
7. **Set up monitoring** and alerts

### Dependency Security

Regularly update dependencies:

```bash
npm outdated
npm update
npm audit fix
```

## 🔐 Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure principles:

1. **Do not disclose** vulnerabilities publicly
2. **Give us time** to fix before disclosure
3. **Work with us** to coordinate disclosure
4. **Allow credit** for responsible disclosure

## ⚠️ Known Security Considerations

### API Endpoints

All API endpoints are rate-limited to prevent abuse:
- Default: 100 requests per 15 minutes
- Configurable via environment variables

### BSC RPC Connections

- Uses public BSC RPC endpoints
- No sensitive credentials stored
- Consider using private RPC for production

### No Database

ValiBNB doesn't store transaction data, reducing attack surface:
- No SQL injection risks
- No data persistence
- Stateless by design

## 🎯 Security Roadmap

Upcoming security improvements:

- [ ] Add API key authentication
- [ ] Implement request signing
- [ ] Add IP whitelisting
- [ ] Add smaller monitoring
- [ ] Security audit by third party
- [ ] Bug bounty program

## 📞 Contact

For security concerns:
- Email: security@validnb.org (to be configured)
